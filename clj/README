# jelly clojure bindings and pool shell

A set of bindings for using the jelly API in clojure, and as an
interactive pool shell.

## Installation

All you need is _leiningen_. Download the script from
[http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/raw/master/bin/lein](here),
make it executable, put it in your path, and invoke:

    lein self-install

After that, you're ready to go: in this directory, get the jars used
by jelly (include clojure) using:

    lein deps

and compile jelly's java side with:

    lein javac

and you can start playing with the REPL with:

    lein repl

or, if you're an emacs-head,

    lein swank

will make your day.

A ready-to-use jar, containing not only jelly but also clojure and all
other dependencies can be created with

    lein uberjar

You can send the resulting jar to anyone: she will only need a working
java 1.6 to start the pool shell using:

    java -jar jelly-standalone.jar
