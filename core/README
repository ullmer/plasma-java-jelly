This directory contains the core jelly library.

Jelly's public interface lives in the package com.oblong.jelly. All
other packages found under it are implementation details.

* Requirements

  Jelly compiles with any Java 1.6 or 1.5 JDK, and uses no OS specific
  APIs.

  It's been tested with Sun's JDK/JRE 1.6 and 1.5 under GNU/Linux and
  Mac OS X 10.6, and with OpenJDK 1.6 under GNU/Linux.

*** Library dependencies

    Jelly has no run time dependencies on external libraries. The jars
    in '../lib' are used for unit tests (JUnit) and compile-time
    annotations, and are only relevant during building and testing.

* Building

  To build jelly you need Ant 1.7 or better, or Eclipse. All other
  dependencies are included in the '../lib' folder.

*** Ant targets

    - =ant compile= will compile the library's source, with output to
      build/classes.
    =- ant build= generates the jelly jar file, inside the dist folder.
    - =ant test= runs the test suite, writing plain text reports inside
      build/test/data.
    - =ant test-reporting= works as =ant test=, but also creates HTML
      reports in build/test/reports.
    - =ant javadoc= generates the library javadoc and puts it in
      build/javadoc.
    - =ant doxygen= generates the documentation using doxygen, inside
      build/doxygen. Doxygen has some problems recognizing Java enums
      and some other constructs: using javadoc is recommended.

    Use =ant -p= for a complete list of targets.

*** Configurable options

    Running =ant properties= will list all properties used by the build
    scripts. You can override any of them either by using ant's -D
    flag or by creating a properties file called build.properties.

*** Building for Java 1.5

    Of particular interest are the build properties compile.source and
    compile.target. By default, they are set to 1.6. You can create a
    1.5 jar with the following incantation:

         ant clean
         ant -Dcompile.source=1.5 -Dcompile.target=1.5 build

*** Using Eclipse

    Just create a new project from existing sources, pointing to this
    directory. Sources are under 'src' and, for tests, under 'test'.
    You'll also need to add to the project's classpath all jar files
    under 'lib'.

    Alternatively, you can create an ant-based project in Eclipse,
    pointing it to build.xml in this directory.
