* Directory contents

  This folder contains Oblong's Android apps using Jelly.

  - core: shared code, in the form of an android library. You don't
    need to compile it individually: each application compiles it.

  - imagine: a demo sending images to a remote pool.

  - ponder: a pond, i mean, pool monitor.

* App build instructions

*** Using Ant to build apps

    You'll need ant 1.6 or better.

    In each application you want to build, a file called
    `local.properties' must be created, containing the location of
    your android installation directory. The easiest way to create it
    is by is via the command:

       $ android update project -p $PWD

    run inside the app directory. That's it: you can use ant to
    compile and install the application. Use `ant help' for a list
    of targets.

*** Using Eclipse

    After installing the ADT plugin, just create a new Android
    project, and direct the wizard to use existing sources, pointing
    to the app directory.
