* Directory contents

  This folder contains Oblong's Android apps using Jelly.

  - core: shared code, in the form of an android library. You don't
    need to compile it individually: each application compiles it.

  - imagine: a demo sending images to a remote pool.

  - ponder: a pond, i mean, pool monitor.

* App build instructions

*** Using Ant to build apps

    You'll need ant 1.6 or better.

    In each application you want to build, a file called
    `local.properties' must be created, containing the location of
    your android installation directory. The easiest way to create it
    is by is via the command:

       $ android update project -p $PWD

     more complete command for applications:

       $ android update project --subprojects -p ./ -n ${PWD##*/} --target android-8

     or for librabries

       $ android update lib-project -p ./ 

    run inside the app directory. That's it: you can use ant to
    compile and install the application. Use `ant -p` for a list
    of targets. For example to compile in debug mode:
    
        $ ant debug
        
    or you can compile and install the app to a connected device

        $ ant debug install

 
*** Using Eclipse

    After installing the ADT plugin, just create a new Android
    project, and direct the wizard to use existing sources, pointing
    to the app directory (e.g., <top>/droid/imagine).

    You also need to add a new source directory, using Project
    properties > Java Build Path > Source > Link source, pointing to
    <top>/core/src (name it jelly-src, say), and add all the libraries
    in <top>/core/lib to your android app project (using Project
    properties > Java Build Path > Libraries > Add External Jars.
