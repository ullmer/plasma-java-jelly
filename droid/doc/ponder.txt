To properly implement the abbreviated list of proteins, bug #534 needs
to be fixed (it's a feature request for plasma that Patrick has agreed
on) and the functionality added to jelly (shouldn't be difficult).

* Protein inspector:
TBD: we need to think of ways of representing different data types,
separate descrips from ingests, what to do with rogue data, etc.  .
Depending of how ambitious we're here, additional hacking time
will be required.

* Bookmarks:
Two scroll lists: pool servers and pools.
Each bookmark can be given a nick name.

In future versions one can get fancy here: sorting criteria, icon
view, adding a bookmark to the phone's home as an icon.

* Set Alarm: 
For a given pool, we can introduce a descrip (initially limiting
ourselves to strings), and a notification icon will appear in the
phone's notification area. There are some subtleties involved, like
reconnecting to the pool (or not) when the connection is lost. Making
this functionality robuts may take some additional work that we can
defer for later.
